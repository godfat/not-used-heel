== DESCRIPTION

Heel is a small static web server for use when you need a quick web server for a
directory.  Once the server is running, heel will use
{launchy}[http://copiousfreetime.rubyforge.org/launchy/] to open your browser at
the URL of your document root.

Heel is built using {Rack}[http://rack.rubyforge.org] and
{Thin}[http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/]
